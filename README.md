# Code Test for Fever (MVVM with Databinding)

Captain Kirk is checking the crew database of the Enterprise in order to prepare for its next 5
year mission to boldly go where no man has gone before. Every member of the crew is assigned
to one of these areas: Science (blue), Engineering (red) or Command (yellow), and belong to
one of these races: Human, Betazoid or Vulcan. Each of the races have certain advantages and
weaknesses that assess a multiplier of x3 on their best area, x2 on the one above average and
x1 on the normal one. No race can tie with another in any area.

Humans’ courage and determination produce excellent officers, however, they are not as
advanced as other races and still do not have the grasp of science Vulcans have, although their
crafty and witty minds allow them to perform quite well on the engineering department. Mr. Scott
argues that he is still the best Engineer in the Starfleet anyway.

On the other hand, Vulcans analytical and logical reasoning offers a nice advantage on key
positions around the ship, keeping discipline and order on their posts. Unfortunately, their lack of
flexibility allows their enemies to outmatch them because of this predictability. The Engineering
department shows no challenges to them, which causes the Vulcans to get more interest on the
Science one.

Last but not least, Betazoid tend to empathize too much with their peers, which is very useful in
Engineering, where the team must work as a whole to overcome dire situations. However, with
such sensible beings, it is easy for them to be overwhelmed in hostile conditions. Being a more
advanced race than the Humans, their knowledge of the world is ahead of the latest, but lack the
efficiency and dedication of the Vulcans to know the mysteries of the cosmos.

Your mission as a Starfleet developer is:

● Model the necessary class (or classes).

● Randomly generate the data for a test. Take into account that the USS Enterprise has a
crew complement of no less than 430. This process will be considered of an
indeterminate amount of time.

● Provide a UI in the shape of a list. The list must be able to be sorted alphabetically or
position [Command > Science > Engineering] showing the best crewmembers first and
in case of tie, alphabetically first. This process will also be considered of an
indeterminate amount of time.

● Use this layout for each of the list cells.
